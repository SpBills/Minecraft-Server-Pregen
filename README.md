# Minecraft Worldgen Tool

## How to use

Make sure that you have Docker installed. Runs best on a Linux machine.

Enter the directory.

`docker-compose up`

This will take a while. Let it run for an hour or two, and then simply stop the server. Then zip the `world` file and place it where you'd like it!
